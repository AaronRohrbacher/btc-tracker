                <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin is a crytocurrency and electronic payment system that can be used to purchase goods and services anywhere in the world. Cryptocurrency allows Bitcoins to be a secure transaction medium as well as regulating the creation of additional coins to the market. One of the most important aspects of Bitcoins or other crytocurrencies is that it is completely decentralized. The system relies on other Bitcoin holders. The more coins mined and held, the higher the price of the coin as its scarcity increases. However, if a large holder of coins was to sell them then they would effectively devalue the currency.
