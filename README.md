The Cryptocurrency Tracker website provides the current price of Bitcoin, Ethereumm, and Litecoin (courtesy of Crypto-Compare's API). We also provide information about what Bitcoin is and how it is "mined" along with a map of local businesses where you can spend Bitcoin. In the Portfolio tab, you can mock purchase a Bitcoin at market price and watch it's value soar. We also included price converters on the page that convert BTC, ETH, and LTC into USD and vice versa based on the current market price.
